# GeoNamesEmbedding
Word2Vec embedding of place names and geographic terms.

I initially created this in August, 2019, for use on GeoGenius, a geography portal I co-founded. However, it proved unessecary for the task at hand so I have not touched it since then. I was able to create some pretty good embeddings so I'm pushing it to Github.

The corpus consists of thousands of geography factfiles and questions that were synthesized into models using Word2Vec from Gensim, and some of the models have created some truly impressive connections, in my opinion. If anybody wants to try them out feel free!
